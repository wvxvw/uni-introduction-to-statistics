\label{sec-1}

\subsection{Problem 1}
\label{sec-1-1}
Given the probabilities of two basketball teams $A$ and $B$ of
\begin{description}
\item[{winning}] $P(W | A) = 0.6$, $P(W | B) = 0.3$.
\item[{drawing}] $P(D) = 0.1$.
\end{description}


\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the chance the teams will play only two games to establish
the winner?
\item The third game was a draw.  What is the chance $A$ wins in the
first round?
\item Provided $A$ wins the tournament, what is the chance that at least three
games had been played?
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Answer 1}
\label{sec-1-1-1}
The way to look at this problem is equivalent to counting all game pairs
where either $A$ wins twice or $B$ wins twice or either one of the games is
a draw, and dividing it into all possible outcomes (the $\Omega$) of two
consequent games.  Since the probabilities of winning are independent, using
the product law, $A$ will win with probability $0.6 \times 0.6$ and $B$ will
win with the probability $0.3 \times 0.3$.  Whereas the probability of two
games finishing with any result is trivially 1.  Since the probabilities of
both teams winning subsequent games are disjoint, we sum them, up, and this
gives us $0.1 + 0.36 + 0.09 - 0.01 = 0.54$ chance of tournament ending
after playing just two games.  (0.01 was added to compensate for the case
when teams draw two times).
\subsubsection{Answer 2}
\label{sec-1-1-2}
Since we already given that there was a third game, we will only concern
ourselves with three different possibilities this could've happen:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Two draws.
\item $A$ wins $B$ wins.
\item $B$ wins $A$ wins.
\end{enumerate}

It is easy to see (from commutativity of multiplication) that options (2)
and (3) are equally likely, thus the chance of $A$ being the first to
win is $(1 - 0.1 \times 0.1) / 2 = 0.495$.
\subsubsection{Answer 3}
\label{sec-1-1-3}
The chance of $A$ not winning in just two games is the chance of $A$ winning
two subsequent games, or winning a game and drawing.  Since the probability
of $A$ is a given, substracting from it the chance of $A$ winning in under
three games will give us the chance of $A$ winning in three games or more:
$0.6 - 0.6 \times 0.6 + 2 \times 0.1 \times 0.6 = 0.36$.

Below is the model testing the answers:

\begin{verbatim}
import random

def random_game():
    game = random.random()
    if game < 0.1: return 'draw'
    elif game < 0.4: return 'b'
    else: return 'a'

def tournament():
    winner = None
    previous = None
    turns = 0
    game = []
    while not winner:
        candidate = random_game()
        turns += 1
        if candidate == 'a' and previous in ['a', 'draw']:
            winner = 'a'
        elif candidate == 'b' and previous in ['b', 'draw']:
            winner = 'b'
        previous = candidate
        game.append(candidate)
    return winner, turns, game

def game_ends_in_two(tries):
    two_rounds_games = 0
    for i in xrange(tries):
        winner, turns, game = tournament()
        if turns == 2:
            two_rounds_games += 1
    return float(two_rounds_games) / tries

def a_wins_three_rounds_game(tries):
    games = 0
    a_wins = 0
    for i in xrange(tries):
        winner, turns, game = tournament()
        if len(game) > 2 and game[2] == 'draw':
            games += 1
            if game[0] == 'a': a_wins += 1
    return float(a_wins) / games

def chance_player_wins(player, times):
    wins = 0
    for i in xrange(times):
        winner, turns, game = tournament()
        if winner == player:
            wins += 1
    return float(wins) / times

def chance_game_won_by(player, times):
    wins = 0
    for i in xrange(times):
        if player == random_game():
            wins += 1
    return float(wins) / times

def at_least_three_games_played(times):
    good = 0
    games = 0
    for i in xrange(times):
        winner, turns, game = tournament()
        if winner == 'a':
            games += 1
            if len(game) > 2:
                good += 1
    return float(good) / games
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Problem 2}
\label{sec-1-2}
Some of the plates produced in a factory can be defective in two different
ways: with a chance of 0.15 there can be cracks in a plate and with a chance
of 0.25 the coloring of the plate may not be uniform.  The chance the
plate will be defective is 0.35.

\begin{enumerate}
\item One plate was found to be defective, what is the chance of this plate
to have cracks?
\item One plate was found to have cracks, what is the chance it will also
have uneven coating?
\item A plate was found to have no cracks, what is the chance of the plate
to be painted unevenly?
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Answer 4}
\label{sec-1-2-1}
Total probability of having cracks is given to be 0.15, the probability of
being defective is 0.35, thus the chance of a plate having cracks, provided
it is defective is 0.15 in 0.35, i.e. $\num{0.428571428571}$.
\subsubsection{Answer 5}
\label{sec-1-2-2}
The chance of a plate having both cracks and uneven coating is one in three.
This is easy to see using the formula $P(A \cap B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cup B)$.
Substituting gives: $P(A \cap B) = 0.15 + 0.25 - 0.35 = 0.05$.
\subsubsection{Answer 6}
\label{sec-1-2-3}
Of all plates 0.65 aren't defective, of the rest 0.1 have cracks, but are
painted properly (recall the result obtained in \ref{sec-1-2-2}.), thus the chance
of a plate to have been painted unevenly is $1 - 0.65 - 0.1 = 0.25$.
\subsection{Problem 3}
\label{sec-1-3}
Three coffee grinding machines produce all the coffee packed at a factory.
Machine $A$ grinds 0.55 of all the coffee, machine $B$ grinds 0.3 and machine
$C$ grinds the remaining 0.15 of coffee.  The coffee can be of fine or of a
coarce grind.  With a chance of 0.4, the machine $A$ produces fine grinds of
coffee.  The machine $B$ produces fine grinds with the 0.5 chance.
It is also known that the chance of producing fine grind of coffee overall
is 0.4.

\begin{enumerate}
\item A chosen pack of coffee was produced by machine $C$.  What is the chance
the coffee was ground finely?
\item A chosen pack of coffee was found to be of a fine grind.  What is the
chance it was produced by machine $B$?
\item Are events ``the coffee is finely ground'' and ``the coffee was ground
by the machine $A$'' are independent?
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Answer 7}
\label{sec-1-3-1}
The chance of a pack of coffee to be ground finely, given it came from machine
$C$ is the total chance of coffee being ground finely sans the chance it
was ground finely and came from the machine $A$ or $B$.  Thus:
$x = \frac{0.4 - 0.55 \times 0.4 - 0.3 \times 0.5}{0.15} = 0.2$.
\subsubsection{Answer 8}
\label{sec-1-3-2}
The chance of a pack of coffee originating from machine $B$ is the chance
it was a finely ground coffe produced by machine $B$ divided by the total
chance it was finely ground: $x = \frac{0.3 \times 0.5}{0.4} = 0.375$.
\subsubsection{Answer 9}
\label{sec-1-3-3}
These events are not independent.  Independent events are such that their
intersection is an empty set, but there are clearly packs of coffee produced
by machine $B$, which are also finely ground \emph{(exactly half of them)}.

\subsection{Problem 4}
\label{sec-1-4}
Given a choice of three loaded coins, $A$ with a chance of tails being $\frac{1}{3}$,
$B$ with the chance of tails being $\frac{1}{2}$ and $C$ with the chance of tails
being $\frac{2}{3}$.  A random coin is selected.

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the chance of tossing tails?
\item Same coin is tossed one more time, what is the chance it lends tails twice?
\item Given the coin landed tails twice, what is the chance the coin tossed
is the fair one?
\item Given the coin landed tails twice, what is the chance it will lend tails
again?
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Answer 10}
\label{sec-1-4-1}
Since there is no preference towards any one of three coins, we will treat
the chance of choosing one as being equally likely.  Thus the chance of
tossing tails is simply the average of the three:
$x = \Big(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{3}\Big) \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{2}$.
\subsubsection{Answer 11}
\label{sec-1-4-2}
Using the product law and the previous answer gives
$\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}$.
\subsubsection{Answer 12}
\label{sec-1-4-3}
We can calculate how each one of the coins contributes towards the total
chance of tossing tails (obtained in the previous answer).  This is given by
$P(A) = \frac{1}{9}$, $P(C) = \frac{4}{9}$ and $P(B) = \frac{1}{4}$.  The
probability of choosing the fair coin given it landed tails twice is the
$\frac{P(B)}{P(A) + P(B) + P(C)} = \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{36}{29} = \frac{9}{29}$.
\subsubsection{Answer 13}
\label{sec-1-4-4}
The chance of coin landing whichever way is independent of how it landed before,
so it will be the same as the chance of a coin landing tails, already given
in the \ref{sec-1-4-1}, viz. $\frac{1}{2}$.
