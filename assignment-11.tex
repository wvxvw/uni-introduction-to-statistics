\section{Problems}
\label{sec-1}

\subsection{Problem 1}
\label{sec-1-1}
Given the grades in an engineering faculty were as follows:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rrr}
lower & higher & graded\\
\hline
30 & 60 & 15\\
60 & 75 & 45\\
75 & 85 & 45\\
85 & 100 & 15\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Present the data using a histogram.
\item Calculate mode, median, algebraic average and variance.
\item Calculate the number of students who earned at least 82 points.
\item Given the following data for the preceding year for 80 students
where the average grade was 70 and variance was 200, find the
average and the variance for two years combined.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Answer 1}
\label{sec-1-1-1}

\lstset{language=R,label=students-histogram,numbers=none}
\begin{lstlisting}
library(ggplot2)
tbl$avg <- (tbl$lower + tbl$higher) / 2
ggplot(tbl) + 
    geom_histogram(
        aes(x = avg, weight = graded, fill = ..count..), 
        breaks = unique(append(tbl$lower, tbl$higher)),
        position = "identity", colour = "black") +
            xlab("grades")
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Answer 2}
\label{sec-1-1-2}
As easy to see from the diagram, there are two \textbf{modes}: one is in the
(60, 75] range, an another is in the (75, 85] range.

The \textbf{median} is the value at the 60'th studen, which is easy to see
from the table as being the 75 points.
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    Md &= \frac{\frac{n}{2} - F(x_{m-1})}{f(x_m)} * (L_1-L_0)+L_0 \\
    Md &= \frac{\frac{120}{2} - 60}{45} * (85 - 75) + 75 \\
    Md &= \frac{60 - 60}{45} * (85 - 75) + 75 \\
    Md &= 75
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

The \textbf{average} is given by the formula:
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    \frac{15 * \frac{30 + 60}{2} + 45 * \frac{60 + 75}{2} +
      45 * \frac{75 + 85}{2} + 15 * \frac{85 + 100}{2}}{15 + 45 + 45 + 15} = \\
    \frac{15 * 90 + 45 * 135 + 45 * 160 + 15 * 185}{2 * 120} = \\
    \frac{17400}{240} = \\72.5
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

And the \textbf{variance}:
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    S^2 &= \frac{\sum_1^n (x - \overline{x})^2 * f(x)}{n} \\
    S^2 &= \frac{(45 - 72.5)^2 * 15 + (67.5 - 72.5)^2 * 45 +
      (80 - 72.5)^2 * 45 + (92.5 - 72.5)^2 * 15}{120} \\
    S^2 &= \frac{756.25 * 15 + 25 * 45 + 56.25 * 45 + 400 * 15}{120} \\
    S^2 &= \frac{21000}{120} \\
    S^2 &= 175
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
\subsubsection{Answer 3}
\label{sec-1-1-3}
Using a slightly altered formula for the median, we can calculate the 82'nd
percentile.  It is easy to see that the 82'nd percentile falls in the third
group, viz. [75, 85) interval.  Assuming values are uniformly distribute
in this interval, ${7 \over 10}$ of these are below 82 and ${3 \over 10}$
are above.  In other words, we need to take 0.3 of the 45 students in this
category, i.e. 13.5, together with 15 students who earned more points this
gives roughly 19 students.
\subsubsection{Answer 4}
\label{sec-1-1-4}
New average is just the weighted average of both averages:
$\frac{70*80+72.5*120}{80+120}=71.5$.

The total variance is calculated using
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    s_1 &= n(S_1 + \overline{x}^2_1) \\
    s_1 &= 120 * (175 + 72.5^2) \\
    s_1 &= 651750. \\
    s_2 &= n(S_2 + \overline{x}^2_2) \\
    s_2 &= 80 * (200 + 70^2) \\
    s_2 &= 408000.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    S^2 &= \frac{s_1 + s_2}{n_1 + n_2} - \overline{x}^2 \\
    S^2 &= \frac{651750 + 408000}{200} - 71.5^2 \\
    S^2 &= \frac{651750 + 408000}{200} - 5112.25 \\
    S^2 &= 186.5
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
\subsection{Problem 2}
\label{sec-1-2}
Given the number of assignments submitted in 2009 (shown below):

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rr}
assignments & students\\
\hline
0 & 11\\
1 & 18\\
2 & 28\\
3 & 22\\
4 & 15\\
5 & 16\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw a bar chart representing the data.
\item Find mode, median, algebraic average and variance.
\item In addition to the number of assignments submitted, students
also received final grades.  Let $X$ be the number of assignments
submitted, let $Y$ be the grade the student received.  Given also that
Pearson coefficient is $r=0.75$.

\textbf{Prove or disprove:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $Y = 0.75X + 96.25$.
\item The number of assignments submitted negatively correlates with
the final grade they received.
\end{enumerate}

\item An investigation found data on 10 more students.  5 of them didn't
submit any assignment and 5 of them submitted 5 assignments each.
Describe what will happen to each metric calculated in question 2 relying
on the previously obtained values.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Answer 5}
\label{sec-1-2-1}
\lstset{language=R,label=assignments-histogram,numbers=none}
\begin{lstlisting}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = tbl, 
       aes(x = assignments, y = students, fill = assignments)) +
           geom_bar(colour = "black", stat = "identity")
\end{lstlisting}

\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{images/assignments.pdf}
\subsubsection{Answer 6}
\label{sec-1-2-2}
\textbf{Mode} for the assignments data is 2, i.e. most of the students submitted
only two assignments.

\textbf{Median} is $2+(3-2)/2=2.5$ (because there is an even number of bins).

Weighted \textbf{average} can be obtained using
$\frac{0*11+1*18+2*28+3*22+4*15+5*16}{110}=\frac{280}{110}=2.45(45)$.

\textbf{Variance} can be obtained using:
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    S^2 &= \frac{(0 * 11)^2 + (1 * 18)^2 + (2 * 28)^2 +
      (3 * 22)^2 + (4 * 15)^2 + (5 * 16)^2}{110} - 2.45^2 \\
    S^2 &= \frac{17816}{110} - 6.0025 \\
    S^2 &= 161.963636364 \\
    S^2 &\simeq 162
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{Answer 7}
\label{sec-1-2-3}
While it seems appealing, it isn't really possible to have a determination
coefficient predict the value of another variable with absolute certainity
unless the coefficient is equal to one.  Thus $Y = 0.75X + 96.25$ is at best
a lucky coincidence.

Positive coefficient means that there exists positive correlation between
two variables.  In particular, it means that roughly in three fourth of all
cases the number of assignments submited perfectly predicted the final grade.
So the claim is obviously false.
\subsubsection{Answer 8}
\label{sec-1-2-4}
After adding ten more observations the \textbf{mode} will not change as the
observations fall into the bins which aren't as dense as the most dense one,
i.e. the first bin will contain 11+5=16 students
\emph{(fewer than 28 of the densest bin)} and 6+5=11 in the last bin.

The \textbf{median} will not change either because we are adding observations to
the outermost bins in an equal measure.

The \textbf{average} will almost not change because the added observations will
``cancel out'', however, it will shift very slightly towards the upper
end, since we increased the relative weight of the bin of those who
submitted the most assignments.

Since \textbf{variance} is affected by the mean, it is hard to tell without
doing full recalculation whether it will or will not change.  However,
since we added more borderline observations, which are most likely to
be far away from the mean, we'd expect the variance to grow.
